# I wish I did something
As I stand here, I am reminded of the infinite choices we seem to have in life, yet the reality is that our options are often limited. We are forced to confront situations where we feel helpless, unsure of how to proceed. For instance, being harassed in a car, I fear being taken away from my destination, the uncertainty of what might come next weighing heavily on my mind. In these moments, I find myself frozen, unable to make a decision, choosing silence as my response, pretending that nothing is happening. My overthinking skills have taken me nowhere but pain.
But the question lingers in my mind - to resist or not to resist? I am faced with a power imbalance and the fragility of my mental state, and I realize that courage eludes me. The sense of lack of courage surrounds me every moment.  
Before doing this test, remember that everything that comes up in the test - thoughts, experiences, guesses, distinctions between good and evil - is from what I perceive.
Before doing this test or before you start over again, remember that everything that comes up in the test - thoughts, experiences, guesses, distinctions between good and evil - is from what I perceive.
The concept of good and evil in my mind is determined by my degree of liking or disliking for something. For example, when I see a roach, I define it as evil because I am afraid of insects, so it is evil to me. For many, a roach may be a lovely creature, and I respect people's preference and  perspective. Alternatively, consider the "good behavior" mentioned in the test. To me, these choices represent how the standard of "good" adults have been instilled in my ears since childhood, based on their definitions. Similarly, the way that my mom defines goodness, which she spread to me, may have been something that she heard from someone else who heard it from others. You may not agree with me entirely, and I accept your disagreement.
In this test, it may appear that you have been given a multitude of options, yet in reality, you can only choose to become either Chenpi or a roach.
How can a  roach become human in the next life?
By doing good deeds, experiencing various deaths, and trying again and again. Through cycles of rebirth, renewal, and choice.
And how does one become Chenpi, one may ask? The answer is uncertain, as it is your only choice. Of course, you can also choose death at any moment. The death I predict is a simulated death, an experience of powerlessness. Welcome to my experience world. Let's start from the beginning.
